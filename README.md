# Car-Dealership-Admin
A database administrative tool for a car dealership.

## Description
Designed and implemented a database tool for a car dealership where administrators will be able to inquire about the current list of vehicles, add or remove
vehicles, and perform other actions (review discounts or perform a search). Certain files are contained to test & debug internal functions. This particular project uses procedural programming and was created for my introductory programming class (UMass Amherst ECE122).
