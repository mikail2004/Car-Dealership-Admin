# Car-Dealership-Admin
A database administrative tool for a car dealership.

## Description
Designed and implemented a database tool for a car dealership where administrators will be able to inquire about the current list of vehicles, add or remove
vehicles, and perform other functions. This particular project uses procedural programming and was created for my introductory programming class (UMass Amherst ECE122).
